# Hotel Booking Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data to understand customer behavior, booking patterns, and cancellation rates. The analysis helps identify business opportunities and operational improvements for hotels.

## Dataset
The dataset contains hotel booking information including:
- Booking dates
- Customer details
- Room types
- Cancellation status
- Average daily rate (ADR)
- And other relevant features

## Project Structure
1. **Data Loading**: Importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Initial examination of data structure and statistics
3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing outliers
   - Converting data types
4. **Visualization**: Creating charts to understand key metrics
5. **Analysis**: Deriving insights from the cleaned data

## Key Findings
- Approximately 37% of bookings are canceled
- The dataset contains information on both resort and city hotels
- Significant data cleaning was required to handle missing values and outliers

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive analysis)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy`
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook Hotel_booking.ipynb`

## Future Work
- Deeper analysis of cancellation reasons
- Seasonal booking patterns
- Customer segmentation
- Predictive modeling for cancellations
